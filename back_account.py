# For this assignment, we'll add some functionality to the User class:

# make_withdrawal(self, amount) - have this method decrease the user's balance by the amount specified
# display_user_balance(self) - have this method print the user's name and account balance to the terminal
# eg. "User: Guido van Rossum, Balance: $150
# BONUS: transfer_money(self, other_user, amount) - have this method decrease the user's balance by the amount and add that amount to other other_user's balance

# declare a class and give it name User
class User:		
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Michael"
        self.email = "michael@codingdojo.com"
        self.account_balance = 0
